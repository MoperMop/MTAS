      <h2>Dissasociative Identity Disorder (DID)</h2>

      <blockquote cite="https://nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Dissociative-Disorders/Overview">
        <p>Up to 75% of people experience at least one depersonalization/<wbr>derealization episode in their lives, with only 2%
          meeting the full criteria for chronic episodes. Women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with a dissociative
          disorder.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote cite="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9792-dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder">
        <p>A person with DID has two or more distinct identities. The “core” identity is your usual personality. “Alters” are
          your alternate personalities. Some people with DID have up to 100 alters. Alters tend to be very different from one
          another. The identities might have different genders, ethnicities, interests, and ways of interacting with their
          environments.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/dissociative-disorders/what-are-dissociative-disorders">
        <p>The attitude and personal preferences (for example, about food, activities, clothes) of a person with dissociative
          identity disorder may suddenly shift and then shift back. The shift in identities happens involuntarily, is unwanted
          and causes distress. People with dissociative identity disorder may feel that they have suddenly become observers of
          their own speech and actions, or their bodies may feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite gender,
          huge and muscular).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This next quote is an explanation of the stigma behind DID from someone who has DID.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/June-2021/Dissociative-Identity-Disorder-A-Misrepresented-Diagnosis">
        <p>While I no longer identify as a victim of my childhood maltreatment — I identify as a survivor — I am certainly not a
          perpetrator either. The message we receive from movie depictions of DID, however, suggests that I am someone to be
          feared. In the movie “Split,” a person living with a DID diagnosis imprisons, kills and eats three women. He even has
          an alter named “The Beast” that commits a variety of violent crimes. By contrast, I never have, nor will I ever, harm
          another person purposefully. I am not dangerous in the least. I’m simply a human being whose brain protected me so
          that I could survive.</p>

      <h2>Kleptomania</h2>
    
    
      <p>Kleptomania is another mental disorder that makes people want to steal things. This disorder was first described in
        1816 who called it “Klepemanie”, the way it works is that the person steals different things just so that they have
        them, it makes them feel like they are worth something. Kleptomania is also linked to hoarders for the same reason
        they feel like they need more stuff so they have value and are worth something. People with this rare condition know
        that they are stealing and they could get in trouble and even feel bad after stealing, but it is an irresistible
        urge to steal, in other words, it is an impulse control disorder. According to the Clevland clinic</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>People who have kleptomania don’t steal because of a lack of willpower, self-control, or a character flaw.
          Instead, this is a medical condition where a person doesn’t have the ability to resist the impulse to steal. It’s
          common for people with kleptomania to feel guilt, shame, or stress about stealing. Many try to compensate for this
          by returning items, donating them to charity, or going back and paying for the items after the fact.</p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>Many people with Kleptomania have suicidal thoughts or self-harm. Kleptomania is a rare condition and only 0.3% -
        0.6% in the world, According to Hull</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The prevalence of kleptomania in the U.S. general population is unknown but has been estimated at 6 per 1000
          people, which translates into about 1.2 million of the 200 million American adults. Kleptomania is thought to
          account for 5% of shoplifting. Based on total shoplifting costs of $10 billion in 2002,5 this 5% translates into a
          $500 million annual loss to the economy attributable to kleptomania. This loss does not include the costs
          associated with stealing from friends and acquaintances or costs incurred by the legal system. Besides its grave
          toll on individuals and families, kleptomanic behavior carries serious legal consequences: approximately 2 million
          Americans are charged with shoplifting annually. If kleptomania accounts for 5% of these, this translates into
          100,000 arrests.</p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>When to see a doctor: If you can't stop shoplifting or stealing, seek medical advice. Many people who may have
        kleptomania don't want to seek treatment because they're afraid they'll be arrested or jailed. However, a mental
        health provider usually doesn't report your thefts to authorities. Some people seek medical help because they're
        afraid they'll get caught and have legal problems. Or they've already been arrested, and they're legally required to
        seek treatment.</p>
